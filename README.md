## Abstract
We are going to analyse the \href{https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/}{dataset of global remote work salaries}.
We will create visualizations in order to draw insights from the data about how factors like job title or company size contritubute to a persons salary.
Furthermore we will state our hypotheses about how certain factors contribute and test these hypotheses using statistics.
In order to understand how factors are specific facots are correlated with salary, we will use linear regression.

# Toward an understanding of salary distributions in remote workers

This repoitory contains the final project of the Data Litracy Lecture 21/22 by Luca Schaal and Tim Schreier. The project revolved around a large dataset on remote workers, which can be found at [here](https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/). 
There are several notebooks in the code folder that are used to analyze and create plots for the final report, which is in the doc folder.

For a brief preview, the abstract of the report follows here.
## Abstract
 

Our Project revolved around this [dataset of characteristics of global remote worker](https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/).
After an examination of the data source itself, we continued to inspect the data critically and this discuss the data set and its limitations for our investigation in the first paragraph of this report. 
We then continued to inspect the data and found various patters relevant for salary distributions. For the most insightful of these, we included visualizations in this report.
We furthermore investigated our hypotheses that the mean salaries between fully remote jobs and jobs that are only partly remote differ significantly using a standard t-test for independent samples.

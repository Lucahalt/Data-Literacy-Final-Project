# Toward an understanding of salary distributions in remote workers

## Abstract
 

Our Project revolved around this [dataset of characteristics of global remote worker](https://salaries.freshremote.work/download/).. 
After an examination of the data source itself, we continued to inspect the data critically and this discuss the data set and its limitations for our investigation in the first paragraph of this report. 
We then continued to inspect the data and found various patters relevant for salary distributions. For the most insightful of these, we included visualizations in this report.
We furthermore investigated our hypotheses that the mean salaries between fully remote jobs and jobs that are only partly remote differ significantly using a standard t-test for independent samples.
